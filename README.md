# AWS ECS
### Elastic Container Service
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable and fast container management service. You can use it to run, stop, and manage containers on a cluster. With Amazon ECS, your containers are defined in a task definition that you use to run an individual task or task within a service. In this context, a service is a configuration that you can use to run and maintain a specified number of tasks simultaneously in a cluster. You can run your tasks and services on a serverless infrastructure that's managed by AWS Fargate. Alternatively, for more control over your infrastructure, you can run your tasks and services on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances that you manage.
